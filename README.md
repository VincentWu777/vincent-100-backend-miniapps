# Vincent's 100 Backend-Focused Mini Apps (with Some React)

This repository is my personal journey to learn **Python development step by step**.

The goal:  
Build **100 small but complete projects**, mostly focused on **backend (Python + web + database)**, with some projects including a **React frontend** for practice and better presentation.

Each project is a **mini app**, not just a toy example.  
I want every project to feel like a small real product.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn Python **from basics to real backend development**
- Practice building **APIs, services, and small products**
- Get comfortable with:
  - HTTP, REST APIs
  - Databases (SQL, ORMs)
  - Authentication & authorization
  - Project structure & clean code
  - Basic React for selected projects
- Build a **public portfolio** of real, working mini apps

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

**Core focus: Backend**

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Web framework:** FastAPI (main), possibly Flask for a few apps
- **Database:**
  - SQLite for small/local projects
  - PostgreSQL or others for more advanced ones
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy (or similar)
- **Auth:** JWT / session-based auth (for relevant projects)

**Frontend (only for some projects)**

- **React** (with functional components & hooks)
- Minimal UI (focus is on functionality, not design)
- Fetching data from Python APIs

## 📚 Learning Phases Overview

This repository contains 100 backend-focused mini apps built to learn Python development step by step.
Projects progress from basic Python to full backend engineering and product-like mini SaaS systems, with some React frontends.

Below is the structured roadmap.

🐣 Phase 0 — Python Basics (P01–P10)

Simple CLI tools for learning core Python syntax.

🎯 Goals

Practice basic syntax & logic

Input/output

Functions

Error handling

File I/O

🧰 Example Projects

🧮 CLI Calculator

📋 Todo List CLI

🔍 Log Analyzer

🗂 File/Utility scripts

🌐 Phase 1 — Web & API Basics (P11–P20)

First steps into backend development using FastAPI or Flask.

🎯 Goals

Understand HTTP & REST

Build simple JSON APIs

Work without databases (in-memory or file storage)

Learn routes, query params, request/response flow

Return structured JSON

🧰 Example Projects

👋 Hello API

📝 Markdown → HTML API

😂 Random Quote/Joke API

🔐 Mock Login API

🗄️ Phase 2 — Databases & CRUD Backends (P21–P40)

Core backend engineering: APIs + SQL databases.

🎯 Goals

Use SQLite or PostgreSQL

Learn SQL + ORM (SQLAlchemy)

Build CRUD APIs for real resources

Relationships (1-N, N-N)

Pagination, filtering, sorting

Migrations & schemas

🧰 Example Projects

👤 Users CRUD API

📝 Notes / Todos backend

✍️ Blog backend (Posts + Comments)

🔗 URL Shortener backend

⭐ Rating/Review system

⚡ Phase 3 — Backend + React (P41–P70)

Backend remains the focus; selected projects have small React frontends.

🎯 Goals

Connect Python APIs to a React UI

Build minimal UI screens for core features

Practice fetch requests

Forms, inputs, state management

Dashboard & charts

🧰 Example Frontend Projects

📋 Todo app UI

🔁 Habit tracker UI

🔗 URL shortener UI

📝 Markdown Notes editor

📊 Dashboard with analytics

🚀 Phase 4 — Advanced Mini SaaS & Services (P71–P100)

More realistic product-like systems; combining backend skills learned earlier.

🎯 Goals

Authentication & roles

Background jobs

Caching

Webhooks

Multi-user systems

Logging & monitoring

Deployment-oriented design

Some projects are backend services, others are fullstack mini apps.

🧰 Example Projects

📰 Mini blog platform

📇 Personal CRM

🔔 Notification service

📈 Analytics & event tracking

🆘 Helpdesk / ticket system

📚 Wiki app

🏁 Final “Vincent Studio” (combined multi-feature app)
